# WhatsApp Clone

This repository was made as an exercise to learn about **Design Systems**, **Declarative UI** and **Chakra UI**. For this project, I used Next.js and typescript to create a WhatsApp clone to apply those concepts. Check out the end result at: https://chakra-whatsapp-clone.vercel.app/.

### Design Systems

I learnt about the concept of Design Systems when trying to create a scalable component library. At the beginning, it was all so confusing, because the only reference that I had was [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/), and I really didn't like it, I would rather create my on CSS and components.

Through studying, I was able to understand that Design System, at its best is the way that a brand communicates with its customers. That includes, colors, typography, spacing, grids, geometry... and this system does not only apply to web applications, it applies to any product that a company has.

### Declarative UI

While I was trying to learn how to create a good component library, the term Declarative UI came up to me. At first I thought it was strange since the modern web tried to separate structure from styles and that's why HTML and CSS are two separate things. And now this declarative UI concept wanted to go back? At the same time, a part of me liked this idea because I worked on a lot of projects that poorly managed CSS classes and reusing code was nearly impossible. I also learnt that Flutter also uses Declarative UI, so that made me want to check that out.

All paradigms have their trade offs, so I think there is no good or bad here. Declarative UI is good because you can style widgets with the same language as the you are building them, that opens a lot of possibilities to make good interactions with style and structure. By having styles on the same place as the main structure, if there is a bug in any of the widget parts, you know for sure where to look at. The downsides are that the code tends to get really big and hard to read if you don't make components right.

### Chakra UI

Combining those two concepts, I found Chakra UI. It's a Design System library that lets you configure basic tokens like color, spacing, border, typography, etc. It also has a lot of built in accessible components like modals, popovers, tooltips, sliders, etc. And last but not least it uses declarative UI for styling. So if I wanted to learn about Design Systems and Declarative UI fast. Chakra UI was the way to go.
